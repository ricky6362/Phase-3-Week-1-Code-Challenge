# Article Management System

## Overview

This Python program demonstrates an article management system with three classes: `Author`, `Magazine`, and `Article`. These classes allow you to create and manage authors, magazines, and articles.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or copy the code snippets into separate files.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run `main.py` to see example operations and outputs.

## Classes

### Author

The `Author` class represents authors who write articles. Authors can have multiple articles, be associated with multiple magazines, and write articles on various topics.

### Magazine
The `Magazine` class represents magazines that publish articles. Magazines can have multiple articles and contributors (authors), and they are categorized by topics.

### Article
The `Article` class represents articles written by authors and published in magazines. Each article is associated with an author and a magazine.

## Usage
* Import classes from their respective files.
* Create instances of authors, magazines, and articles.
* Use class methods for listing, querying, and associating objects.
* Run main.py for examples and outputs.
